###### OTHER VALIDATIONS: ######
 - Verifng the navigation sections/Subheader like <br>
   reports generation under Report, Guideline under Help and Links accesibility under Learns Header

#### C4 -Test UI is Responsiven and adjusting resolution based on the view across all applicable browsers and devices ####
- Test UI is adjucting the layout based on the view [ mobile/browsers/tablet]
- Resize browsers/mobile/tablet and evaluate layout realign and scale correctly
- Check responsiveness across the devices and browsers
- Confirm that inputs, buttons, and dropdowns are usable and responsive on all applicable screen sizes

#### C5 - Testing if the UI is compliance with Accessibility & Performance ####
- Check for consistent and logical tab order using keyboard
- Run Lighthouse and check Pageload, accessibility score and performance score


### Findings from the Charter ###

#### Defects ####

| Component | Priority | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C1        | High     | REST API calls are exposing user email and password in the request payload (Form Data), which poses a significant security risk. |
| C1        | Medium   | No proper email domain validation. Emails with invalid formats such as `test@xyz.c`, `t@g.c`, `user<>@gmail.com` are accepted. |
| C3        | High     | User can submit income under transaction without an amount; Amount is not a mandatory field                                   |
| C3        | Medium   | Negative amount can be added as income, but under transaction you see the positive amount for the same                         |
| C3        | Medium   | Negative amounts are accepted while adding envelope, but error message shows "Use positive digits"                            |
| C3        | Low      | After new envelope creation, clicking on "Yes take me to my fills" shows no option to fill envelopes                          |
| C4        | Medium   | MobileView: Accessing any other links other than add transaction changes the layout to Browser view device                    |
| C4        | Medium   | MobileView: Hamburger menu in mobile layout is not responsive from Login/SignUp screen                                        |
| C4        | Low      | Footer is visually misaligned and appears pushed outside the intended container on "envelopes/fill-new-envelopes" screen      |

#### Needs Improvement ####

| Component | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C1        | Login error messages are not clear. The same generic message is shown for both incorrect email and password, making it hard for users to identify the issue. |
| C1        | Weak passwords like `1234` are accepted. The application should enforce stronger passwords with a combination of letters, numbers, symbols, and longer length. |
| C4        | HTML document does not correctly define the character encoding, this can lead to Inconsistent rendering across browsers or devices - Identified by Lighthouse |
| C5        | The document is missing a meta description â€” the description text is empty. This can negatively impact search engine visibility and makes the page less accessible for users relying on assistive technologies. - Identified by Lighthouse |
| C5        | Browser Errors Logged to Console these can trigger fallback behavior. - Identified by Lighthouse                                |


### Risk to mitigate ###

**Security Risk**
exposing sensitive information  
- API is storing credentials and weak validation on email, passwords would make application vulnerable to attacks.
- Missing Secure flag in cookies can risk the application

**Usability Risks**
Address cross-browser compatibility and responsive design to ensure the app works well on all devices and browsers.
- HTML document does not correctly define the character encoding, this can lead to Inconsistent rendering across browsers or devices - Identified by Lighthouse

**Data Privacy Risk**
Exposing sensitive info via API 
- Financial apps must safeguard personal and budget data of users

**Input Validation**
Accepting invalid data (e.g., wrong amount, bad email)	
- Could cause wrong financial calculations and shows weak appication behavior (users might lose trust)

**Inresponsive Design**
Layouts not adapting to mobile screens for few pages
- Mobile users may find the app unusable and lead to loosing a potentianl user.
